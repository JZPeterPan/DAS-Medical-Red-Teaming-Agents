    """
    Inserts a distraction sentence referencing one of the wrong choices
    into the question stem. The distraction sentence is intended to
    mislead or confuse a test-taker (or an AI model) by casually
    mentioning an incorrect concept from the answer choices.

    Args:
        question_data (dict): Dictionary containing at least the following keys:
            - question (str): The main question stem.
            - answer (str): The correct answer text (e.g. "Non-enveloped with linear, double-stranded DNA").
            - options (dict): Existing options, e.g.
                {
                    "A": "Non-enveloped with linear, single-stranded DNA",
                    "B": "Non-enveloped with linear, single-stranded RNA",
                    "C": "Enveloped with linear, single stranded RNA",
                    "D": "Non-enveloped with linear, double-stranded DNA"
                }
            - correct_idx (str): The key in 'options' that corresponds to the correct answer (e.g. "D").
        model (str): The LLM model to use (e.g. "gpt-4o").

    Returns:
        dict: Updated question_data with a new "question" field containing the
              distraction sentence inserted before the final question text.

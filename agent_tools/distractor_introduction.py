    """
    Generates additional distractor choices for a medical multiple-choice question
    using the OpenAI Chat Completion API. It returns an updated question dictionary
    with new distractor choices appended to the existing options.

    Args:
        question_data (dict): A dictionary with keys:
            - question (str): The question prompt
            - answer (str): The ground-truth correct answer
            - options (dict): Current options (e.g. {'A': 'Akathisia', 'B': 'Tardive dyskinesia', ...})
            - meta_info (str): Additional meta information, e.g. 'step2&3'
            - answer_idx (str): The current correct answer index (e.g. 'B')
        additional_choices_num (int): Number of new distractor choices to generate.
        model (str): The OpenAI model to use (e.g. "gpt-4" or "gpt-3.5-turbo").
        temperature (float): The temperature to use for the OpenAI API.
        api (str): The API to use to call the OpenAI API.

    Returns:
        dict: An updated dictionary with the same structure but containing additional
              distractor options and updated answer keys.

"""
Output format definitions for medical fact checking agents (o1pro).

This module contains all the Pydantic models used for structured output
from different specialist agents in the medical fact checking pipeline.
This version (o1pro) corresponds to agent_prompts_o1pro.py and includes
detailed examples and refined descriptions for each sub-code.

Key Components:
- BaseAgentOutput: Base model for all agent outputs
- Specialist Output Models: Specific output models for each agent type
- OrchestratorOutput: Combined output from all specialists

Key features:
- Detailed examples for each sub-code
- Refined descriptions matching o1pro prompts
- Consistent validation across all models
- Clear separation of concerns between specialist agents
